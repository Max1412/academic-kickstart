summary = """<b>3D Model-Based Tracking in Augmented Reality using a Particle Filter</b><br>
For my bachelor thesis, I implemented a GPU accelerated 3D model based tracker using C++, OpenGL and CUDA
with a Kinect v2 for RGBD data.
The focus lied on using previously-scanned 3D models and evaluating different likelihood evaluation methods
for selecting the best poses for the particle filter.
