summary = """<b>Interactive Art Installation</b><br>
As a group project in the [working group digital media](https://userpages.uni-koblenz.de/~digitalmedia/) at the University of Koblenz
we created an interactive art installation at the [Ehrenbreitstein Fortress Light Festival](http://www.festungsleuchten.de/)
We used a Microsoft Kinect v2, Unreal Engine 4, stage technology (DMX) and a multi-projector
installation to project peoples movements as shadows to historic environments, linking the Ehrenbreitstein Fortress as it is today
to its past interactively.
