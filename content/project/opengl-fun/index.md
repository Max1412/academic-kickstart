<b>Modern OpenGL framework for prototyping and small projects</b><br>
My OpenGL framework uses C++17 and OpenGL 4.6 and is used for personal
and university projects, small demos and experiments. It uses modern
approaches to GPU-driven rendering like [AZDO](https://www.slideshare.net/CassEveritt/approaching-zero-driver-overhead), [DSA](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Direct_State_Access), [bindless textures](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Bindless_Texture) and [indirect multi-draw](https://www.khronos.org/opengl/wiki/Vertex_Rendering#Indirect_rendering) and makes heavy usage of compute shaders and SSBOs.
It contains code for model loading, processing, rendering, live-reloading for shaders, easy debugging and a practical and condensed abstraction over OpenGL.
