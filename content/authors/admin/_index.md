I am a M.Sc. Student of Computational Visualistics at the University of Koblenz-Landau who
recently submitted his master thesis about hybrid ray tracing using C++ and Vulkan with RTX.
I am passionate about all things rendering, be it ray tracing, rasterization, visualization.
Other interests and skills include computer vision/image processing, 3D math and general programming,
using mainly C++. Welcome to my portfolio page, where you can find everything about my projects, my skills and my education.
